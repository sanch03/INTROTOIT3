    <div class="card" id="introduction">
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>We plan to create a website and phone application which together allow an individual to print out QR Codes or
            write NFC tags that can facilitate a scavenger hunt. The objectives will be called “beacons” and the game
            “host” can create a certain amount of them which the program will then convert into either QR Codes or allow
            the host to write onto NFC tags. These “beacons” can then be placed in random locations in a certain area
            (can be as small as a room or even cover entire countries!) and the players will have to scan the QR Code or
            NFC tag using the corresponding mobile application, which keeps track of remaining beacons in the game and
            can give out hints to the player. The host can set up the game in multiple modes such as assigning players
            to teams or only allowing the beacons to be acquired in a certain order. The host will be able to see all
            the progress on their device and will be notified of the winner.
        </p>
        <h2>Hosting:</h2>
        <p>On the website, the host will create a game that will have a unique code and will select the number of
            beacons they want. Here they will be able to individually name each beacon, enter its geographic location
            (optional), add a clue on how to find the beacon (optional) and enter a message they want to be displayed
            when a player captures the beacon (optional). After adding all beacons, the host can set the game mode and
            can then pick if the game will be played with QR Codes or via NFC. If the host selects QR Code, a pdf will
            be generated containing a QR Code for each location which whey can place there. If NFC is selected, the host
            will be prompted to switch to the phone app on an NFC capable phone, where they will be prompted to present
            an NFC card to write to for each beacon.
        </p>
        <h2>Game Modes:</h2>
        <p>The game can be played as a private group or open to the public, when private group beacons are scanned,
            they will require the user to be authenticated before the app accepts them.<br><br>
            The host can pick if the beacons can be captured in any order or a specific order.<br><br>
            If the host supplied a geographical location for a beacon when creating the lobby they can enable
            location verification on the players' devices.<br><br>
            verification, where the player's device location will have to be within a certain radius of the beacon
            location when it is scanned to deter cheating.<br><br>
            Individual: First player to capture all beacons will win.<br><br>
            Team: First team to capture all beacons will win.<br><br>
            Rush: Once a player/team captures a beacon no one else can scan it, once all beacons are captured the
            player/team with the majority of beacons will win.
        </p>
        <h2>Playing:</h2>
        <p>The player will need to log in on either the mobile app or mobile-friendly website. When they scan a QR Code
            or NFC tag it will be read by the app/website and if the user is logged in and has access to the particular
            games lobby, it will be added to their inventory. They will be able to see a list of all the beacons in the
            game and view hints on how to access them, if it is a team game relevant statistics will also be displayed.
            If the host has enabled location verification the app/website will request the user's location to verify
            that they are physically near the beacon location.</p>

        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>If this project is released to the public, there may be personal data that has to be handled appropriately
            and
            additionally security risks with the use of QR Codes and NFC Tags. The service may collect the player's
            location
            if the host requires it and that information should only be stored for verification and not stored on the
            server
            as that would add unnecessary security risks to the service. If the service was to collect a users location
            it
            should only be sent to the server to be checked against the beacon location and then instantly deleted. If
            the
            location was to be left on the server and a malicious entity gained access to it, it could be used to track
            a
            users location for nefarious purposes. Additionally, by not permanently storing user location it can reduce
            some
            liabilities towards us in regards to confidential information storage.</p>

        <p>It would also be ideal if no personal information except for a user identifier was stored on servers. This
            would
            mean that the personalization details for a user (such as name, preferences) would only be stored on the
            users
            device, and the user app would use a UUID (Unique User Identifier) to communicate with the server, making
            the
            service safer overall. One disadvantage to this approach would be that if a user switched devices, all of
            their
            progress would effectively be lost, as there will be no method for the server to authenticate the user.</p>

        <p> The use of QR Codes and NFC Tags also has inherent security risks, as a user may scan a malicious QR Code or
            tap
            a malicious NFC Tag designed to look like a beacon code/tag. Currently, there are no known exploits that
            allow
            code execution on devices that scan QR Codes or NFC Tags, but there have been in the past and thus can exist
            in
            the future, this risk will always exist and there is no easy solution other than temporarily disabling the
            service if an exploit like such is revealed. Additionally, if the user app is a progressive web app, it will
            be
            sandboxed within another layer of security, within the users browser app, reducing the likelihood of a
            zero-day
            QR Code exploit affecting our service. </p>

        <h1>Main Technologies</h1>
        <h2>QR Codes:</h2>
        <p>QR Codes is short for Quick Response Codes, where as the name suggests they can be quickly read and processed
            by a reader. It is most similar to barcodes however it is capable of storing larger amounts of information
            within a combination of pixels in a square grid. The data that can be stored within a QR code includes:
            website URLs, phone numbers or up to 4000 characters of text. Since its creation and release, QR codes have
            been used for many purposes. They are used for marketing or promotional purposes, marking and tracking parts
            within supply chains and as of the recent pandemic times, it is used for contact tracing by getting people
            to check in to places they go to. The use of QR codes within this game would be very simple as they can
            easily be generated and then read, making it a better experience for both the host and players. However, it
            may pose an increased security risk because it is so easy to generate, where as stated above other people
            can create their own QR codes disguised as the game’s, and then potentially steal personal data from
            unsuspecting players.</p>
        <h2>NFC Tags:</h2>
        <p>NFC which is short for Near Field Communication is a wireless technology that allows communication between
            two devices that are within close proximity of each other. The use of NFC tags are often very convenient and
            versatile as all it requires is a tap on the device, which is much quicker and easier than having to open up
            an app and wait for it to scan, such as the use of QR codes. NFC tags most commonly come in the form of a
            circular sticker where there lies a microchip that consists of a copper coil and a tiny storage device. The
            connection is created when a device (NFC reader) is brought into proximity of the tag, a process called
            Electromagnetic Induction occurs where the tag generates a bit of power and then it can transmit data to the
            device. NFC tags are most commonly used in things such as credit cards, hotel keypasses, train cards (Myki,
            Opal) as well as an easy way to connect bluetooth devices just by a tap. NFC tags are also more safer than
            QR codes as it provides more flexibility and control, as it can be programmed in ways that make it more
            secure than a simple barcode.</p>
        <h2>Progressive Web Apps:</h2>
        <p>Progressive Web applications are a cross between a web application and native installed application,
            achievable through the collaboration of various technologies. Because of that, it enables many advantages
            that derive from either the usage of a web app or native app. A PWA can be identified when it includes
            certain features such as: being able to be found through a search engine, able to be installed on a device
            as an application, can be shared by a URL, able to function offline or with a poor network connection, and
            most importantly, it is secure from malicious personnel. PWS with the use of HTTPS web protocol ensures that
            any data stored on the application is secure and is not tampered with, as the technology protects against
            intruders. The use of PWS also ensures that users, in instances where they are signing up to join the game,
            or while they are playing the game, will not accidentally scan the wrong QR code or NFC tag as all of it
            will be linked directly to the URL. This means that each QR code or NFC tag should take the user directly to
            the correct application. Using PWA in the implementation for this game would mitigate a lot of the security
            concerns that arose from just using QR codes or NFC tags by itself.

        <h1>Outcome</h1>
        <p>If this project is successful it will easily allow primary/secondary schools and event organisers to set up a
            scavenger hunt game. It will save them large amounts of time as they need to do very little physical work to
            set it up and for public games, the general public will get to enjoy mysterious QR Codes (although if you
            scan a random QR Code that's concerning) that lead them around places. If governments set up a game that
            covers a city it can cause great engagement within the city, especially with tourists.
