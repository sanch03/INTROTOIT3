        <h1><b>Project Description</b></h1>

        <p>Having completed both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, you will have thought about a personal project as well
            as one with your group. In this Assignment you are to come up with a plan for group project, and to develop
            it as much as possible in the time available. Naturally you will be very unlikely to complete your project;
            in fact, most worthwhile projects are “endless”, in that there is always more that you can do, more features
            to be added, more levels to be designed, or new devices that could be used. Naturally the choice of what to
            do is up to you, but you should take the following into account when making your decision.
        <p> - The passions, interests and skills of your group</p>
        <p>- IT industry trends</p>
        <p>- What would assist you in your career plan</p>
        <p>- Feedback from Assignments 1 and 2</p>
        <p>Your group will have developed some ideas in Assignment 2; it is fine to build on and refine these for this
            assignment, or to develop a new project based on feedback and/or what you have learned since.</p>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="Aims">
        <h1><b> Overview </b></h1>
        <h1> Topic </h1>
        <p> We intend to develop a webpage and a phone application that will allow users to print QR codes or write NFC
            tags to aid in a treasure hunt, it concurrently also be called a scavenger hunt. The host can configure the
            game in a variety of settings, such as allocating players to teams o enabling beacons, which will be able to
            construct a specific number of them, which the computer will then translate into QR codes or similarly allow
            the host to put onto NFC tags, to be obtained in a specific order. The champion will be then contacted, and
            the presenter will be able to witness all of the progression on their tablet. </p>
        <p> If this project is successful, primary/secondary schools and event organisers will be able to quickly set up
            a treasure hunt game. It will save them a lot of time because they only need to do a little physical labour
            to put it up, and for public games, the general public will get to experience intriguing QR codes that guide
            them around areas, however scanning a random QR code is worrying, as this could lead into an induvial such
            as a hacker getting access to the person’s phone who scanned the QR code, however we are trying our best to
            help our participants to only scan the correct QR codes. If government put up a game that encompasses a
            city, it can result in significant participation within the area, particularly among visitors. </p>

        </p>
        <h1> Motivation </h1>
        <p> As a group and as a collective, our motivation behind this project is to get primary and secondary school
            children and also adults to become more physically active, as this project will help primary and secondary
            school children and adults to go out of their comfort zone and the comfort of their home and become more
            competitive, hence making anyone who participates more physically active. This project, from our group’s
            perspective, is interesting and important because of a few reasons, which are as follow: a QR code treasure
            hunt is essentially an exerciser that you can utilise inspire children or adults to be active while locating
            QR codes concealed across for example school, classroom, or local neighbourhood and secondly, scavenger
            hunts are popular amongst youngsters in schools, business offices, celebrations, and promotional events. It
            is also utilised as an orientation exerciser, team-building event, and professional engagement tool, in
            addition to being a fun game. When talking about how our fun and enjoyable game fits within the current IT
            trends, it can be said that whenever an individual or a visitor enters a building or a premises, they have
            to scan a QR code to ‘check in’, signifying the relation of it to the current IT.
        </p>
        <h1> Landscape </h1>
        <p>There are countless similar systems or products which are out there in the world which are available to the
            world, which are very closely aligned with our game, but saying that, our game is/will be extremely unique
            when compared to other similar games. Out in the real world, there are several competitors, which a bonus to
            every business, as that allows every company to outwork the other company, hence making technology more
            advanced. Our competitors include: Beaconstac’s QR Code solution, QR-Code-generator, QR Code Monkey,
            Scanova, the-qrcode-generator, GoQR, Shopify’s QR code generator and QR Stuff. When it comes to talking
            about points of differences there are about our project when compared to what exist now, it can be said that
            the project is very similar to what already exists in world, as there are already existing games which are
            based of scanning QR Codes and revolved around it being a scavenger hunt. The stuff that’s out in the world,
            the main difference between our project and the projects which already exists is the way they operate their
            game, as they way other competitors run their game.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="card" id="Detailed-Description">
        <h1><b> Detailed Description </b></h1>
        <h1> Aims </h1>
        <p>We ambition to make a site and telephone application which together permit a person to print out QR Codes or
            compose NFC labels that can work with a forager chase. The goals will be classified "signals" and the game
            "have" can make a specific measure of them which the program will then, at that point, convert into either
            QR Codes or permit the host to compose onto NFC labels. These "reference points" can then be put in
            arbitrary areas in a specific region (can be just about as little as a room or even cover whole nations!)
            and the players should check the QR Code or NFC label utilizing the relating portable application, which
            monitors remaining guides in the game and can give out clues to the player. The host can set up the game in
            numerous modes like appointing players to groups or just permitting the reference points to be gained in a
            specific request. The host will actually want to see all the improvement on their gadget and will be advised
            of the victor.
        <p> Now moving onto talking about some of our smaller goals, which will, for sure, help us in completing this
            project successfully. It is always helpful to have smaller goals in the project, as they sometimes may guide
            our specific aim in our project. Firstly, our first goal with this project would be finishing this project
            well before the due date arrives. As last time, we struggled to finish our project well prior to the due
            date, it seemed that we were all of a sudden under a lot of pressure, as some components of our project were
            not yet completed. So hence, reflecting of our past, our goal is to complete this project well prior to the
            due date and have more than enough time to go over our project and complete with the best of our ability’s.
        </p>
        <p> Secondly, we would say that our second goal for this project would most definitely be creating our project
            with concentration, therefore the final product, our game, can be extremely enjoyable and will make our
            audience and players want to play our game more often. A small goal such as creating an entertaining and
            amusing game can go a long way, as this can help us with good user experience. </p>
        <p> Lastly, our third aim, we would say, would be that creating a game which would be free of any virus or
            malware dysfunction. We want out game to run smoothly 24/7, we do not desire to create a game which would
            have a lot of deficiencies. A game which can be free from virus can assist us with user experience, and
            additionally can also assist us with preventing potential harm to our files and data. </p>
        </p>
        <h1> Plans and Progress </h1>
        <p>Here you should give as much detail as you can about what your project will do, and how you will do it. This
            should also include how far you have got with developing any features or outcomes from your project. Tell us
            about the “story" of your project – how it began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the plan you are
            up to. Include any dead-ends you may have followed, decisions made, and changes that have been made to the
            project plan. This will need to include a significant amount of detail, so that it is easily seen what
            precisely you have done and are planning to do. If it helps, imagine the information that would be required
            if you were to hand this project over at the end of the semester to a new team to complete the job. What
            would you want to know, if you were one of the people taking over? There is no set length for this section,
            but it is hard to believe that less than two pages could be adequate. Three or four pages is far more
            likely.
        </p>

        <h1> Roles </h1>
        <p>It is sometimes useful to define roles for particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical
            Designer, or User
            Interface Designer. It is also possible that roles are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to
            be done next.
            Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so, describe and justify these. If not, describe
            your process and justify why there are no specific roles.
        </p>
        <h1> Scope and Limits </h1>
        <h2>QR codes and NFC tags-based Scavenger Hunt Game: -</h2>
        <p>We plan to develop a website and mobile app that allows users to print QR codes or write NFC tags to help
            with scavenger hunts. The goals will be referred to as "beacons." The "Host" can build an unlimited number
            of "beacons," which the application will convert to QR codes or NFC tags. These "beacons" can then be set in
            random positions throughout a given region, and players must scan the QR Code or NFC tag using the
            appropriate mobile application, which keeps track of the game's remaining beacons and can provide tips to
            the player.
        </p>
        <h2>Project scope statement</h2>
        <p> The Scavenger Hunt Game that we are developing will provide the players a lot of fun during their monotonous
            leisure time. If the game is played in a large circle across the city, the players are encouraged to travel
            to different locations. This game can also be used at school as an extracurricular activity for pupils,
            providing them with delight and entertainment. </p>
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A QR code and NFC tag-based scavenger hunt game website and mobile application.</li>
            <li>A programme which will convert the beacons into QR codes and NFC tags as per host selection.</li>
            <li>A programme which allows the user to use the camera and NFC feature of the device to scan QR codes and
                NFC tags.</li>
            <li>Access to the city map and location of the beacons and the players.</li>
            <li>A strong database management system to manage the user's personal details and location.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limits: -</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheating in our game is very easy; if someone takes a photo of the QR code and sends it to the player,
                he may scan it and easily win.</li>
            <li>There may be a lack of database administration of QR codes and NFC tags.</li>
            <li>Players will have a significant chance of scanning a malicious QR code or tapping on harmful NFC tags,
                resulting in device software damage, data leak of the user or application crash.</li>
            <li>If the host creates an NFC tags game, players who do not have an NFC capable phone will be unable to
                participate.</li>
            <li>If the host creates an NFC tags game, players who do not have an NFC capable phone will be unable to
                participate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>For our project, there are tools and technologies that are split between developers and end users. For
            developers of this project, there are three main technologies that will be used which are QR Codes, NFC Tags
            and Progressive Web Applications. Lets dive a bit deeper into the three technologies. </p>

        <h2>QR Codes</h2>
        <p>To start off, everyone has probably heard of QR Codes, and in these modern pandemic times, everyone has also
            hopefully scanned at least one as well. In essence, QR codes is an advanced barcode that comes in the form
            of a square. It is capable of storing larger amounts of information within a combination of pixels in a
            square grid. It can also be generated very easily at no cost and as such using QR codes for our project
            would be very feasible. It can also be read and interpreted quite easily with any modern-ish mobile device,
            making it a simple process for end users. </p>

        <h2>NFC Tags</h2>
        <p>Next we have NFC tags. Although not as prominent as QR codes, NFC tags are still also widely used in society.
            NFC tags essentially allow communication between a tag and reader that are within close proximity of each
            other. The use of these tags are more convenient and versatile as compared to QR codes, as all it requires
            is a tap on a device compared to having to open up an app and manually scan the QR code. NFC Tags also can
            be programmed quite easily with the use of an Android or iOS device. As such, using NFC tags for this
            project can be a more secure option, however it costs money (although not very expensive). </p>

        <h2>Progressive Web Applications</h2>
        <p>The use of QR codes and NFC tags can pose large security issues. Who is to say that a random person with
            malicious intent cannot just generate a random QR code, posing as one that is generated as part of our game,
            and have it linked to some sort of malware. Furthermore, in the same sense a random person can also program
            their own NFC tags once again disguised as one created from our game, and have it steal the end users
            personal information. This is where progressive web applications come into play. PWAs are a cross between a
            web and native installed application. Because of that, it takes many advantages from both, and mashes them
            together to create a better application. To address the security issue, we use PWAs because it enforces the
            HTTPs web protocol which ensures that any data stored on the application is secure and not tampered with.
            Also when using PWA, end users are ensured that they are accessing the real game, and not something
            malicious generated by a random person. As developers, we will be using Bootstrap Studio 6.0.1 to create the
            PWA which can then be accessed through a web browser, or a mobile application. </p>

        <h2>Prior Experience within Group</h2>
        <p>Within our group, experience with technologies lie mainly with the use of QR codes as expected. Additionally,
            everyone also has experience with NFC tags in debit/credit cards, using it for contactless payments. As for
            Progressive Web Applications and using Bootstrap Studio, only Sanchit has experience in it. As for the rest
            of us, it would be a new skill to learn. </p>

        <h1>Testing </h1>
        <p>There are three different ways to test an application, which is manual testing, automated testing, and continuous testing. In our project, we will be using manual testing to test our project. It takes more time than automated tools but it’s more accurate than automated tools, it provides human insight, adaptable and save money. In manual testing, the testing process starts with understanding the application that's going to be tested. We will be gathering information about the application and the expectation of the users. When the data is collected, we will integrate the data and save it for later testing. Next steps is to create test scenarios and test cases, We will use the previously collected user needs and expectations to analyze and create a test that meets the requirements. Defects found during testing are recorded and fixed while testing is in progress. The purpose of testing is not only to identifying and reporting defects found, but also to ensure that all reported issues are identified and fixed, and then retested to confirm. After all defects have been eliminated, the acceptance testing method will be used to make sure our apparition is ready to go.
        <p> There will be four types of tests to be used to test our project.</p>
        <p>-	White Box Testing: for testing the behaviour of each of the features in the application. Is a method that allows testers to examine its code, infrastructure, and integration with external systems.  </p>
        <p> -	Black Box Testing: Use it to test user interface, input, and output. It only considers the external behaviour of the system. </p>
        <p> -	Grey Box Testing: Is a method used to perform testing, risk, and assessment methods. </p>
        <p> -	Acceptance Testing: It is a software testing method in which the acceptability of a system is tested. The main purpose of this test is to assess whether the system meets the requirements and whether it can be delivered for use.  </p>

        <h1>Timeframe </h1>
        <p> Our project idea requires a large amount of development time, as a multitude of technologies and systems
            need to
            connect to create a final product. </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            Implement all specified game modes<br>
        </p>
        <h1> Risks </h1>
        <p>What risks can you identify for your project? There will always be some generic risks (such as computers
            breaking down the night before a deadline, health and family issues, and institutional changes). Do not
            include generic risks such as these. The idea is to be as specific as you can to your project. For example,
            if your topic is to develop a game, there may be a risk that the software you choose to work with may be
            very difficult to learn, poorly documented, or not turn out to have the features that it claims it has.
            These properties are often only discovered once you have started working with the software, and so unless
            you have had lots of experience with the particular tool, there is always a risk that it may not work as
            well as you believe it should, no matter how much prior research you do. Similar comments apply to hardware.
        </p>

        <h1>Group Processes And Communications </h1>
        <p>Communication between group members is arguably the most important aspect of your project. Past experience
            has shown that communication breakdowns between group members is the most common cause of project failures,
            so it is vital that you specify at the outset the means and expected frequency of communication between
            group members. How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be
            face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ... ?? What will you
            do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? You should expect contact between
            group members at least twice a week. You can always make contact more often if you wish, but you do need to
            know what minimum frequency is expected from all members of your group. At least one paragraph is expected
            here. </p>
