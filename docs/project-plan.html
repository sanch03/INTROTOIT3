        <h1><b>Project Description</b></h1>

        <p>Having completed both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, you will have thought about a personal project as well as one with your group. In this Assignment you are to come up with a plan for group project, and to develop it as much as possible in the time available. Naturally you will be very unlikely to complete your project; in fact, most worthwhile projects are “endless”, in that there is always more that you can do, more features to be added, more levels to be designed, or new devices that could be used. Naturally the choice of what to do is up to you, but you should take the following into account when making your decision.
<p> - The passions, interests and skills of your group</p>
<p>- IT industry trends</p>
<p>- What would assist you in your career plan</p>
<p>- Feedback from Assignments 1 and 2</p>
<p>Your group will have developed some ideas in Assignment 2; it is fine to build on and refine these for this assignment, or to develop a new project based on feedback and/or what you have learned since.</p>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="introduction">
        <h1><b> Overview </b></h1>
        <h1> Topic </h1>
            <p> An overview of what you propose to do in your project. Concentrate on the big picture and outcomes, rather than
intricate details. At least two paragraphs is expected. </p>

        </p>
        <h1> Motivation </h1>
        <p> What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with
current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is
expected.
        </p>
        <h1> Landscape </h1>
        <p>What similar systems or products are available? What competitors are there? What points of difference are there
about your project compared to what exist now? At least one paragraph is expected.
        </p>


    </div>



    <div class="card" id="introduction">
        <h1><b> Detailed Description </b></h1>
        <h1> Aims </h1>
        <p>The topic description gives a general overview. However, it is usually helpful to have a specific aim for your project, as well as
some smaller goals which will be helpful for achieving your aim. Describe these as best you can. Each project should have a
single aim.

        </p>
        <h1> Plans and Progress </h1>
        <p>Here you should give as much detail as you can about what your project will do, and how you will do it. This should also include how far you have got with developing any features or outcomes from your project. Tell us about the “story" of your project – how it began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the plan you are up to. Include any dead-ends you may have followed, decisions made, and changes that have been made to the project plan. This will need to include a significant amount of detail, so that it is easily seen what precisely you have done and are planning to do. If it helps, imagine the information that would be required if you were to hand this project over at the end of the semester to a new team to complete the job. What would you want to know, if you were one of the people taking over? There is no set length for this section, but it is hard to believe that less than two pages could be adequate. Three or four pages is far more likely.
        </p>

        <h1> Roles </h1>
        <p>It is sometimes useful to define roles for particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical Designer, or User
        Interface Designer. It is also possible that roles are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to be done next.
        Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so, describe and justify these. If not, describe your process and justify why there are no specific roles.
        </p>
        <h1> Scope and Limits </h1>
        <h2>QR codes and NFC tags-based Scavenger Hunt Game: -</h2>
        <p>We plan to develop a website and mobile app that allows users to print QR codes or write NFC tags to help with scavenger hunts. The goals will be referred to as "beacons." The "Host" can build an unlimited number of "beacons," which the application will convert to QR codes or NFC tags. These "beacons" can then be set in random positions throughout a given region, and players must scan the QR Code or NFC tag using the appropriate mobile application, which keeps track of the game's remaining beacons and can provide tips to the player.
        </p>
        <h2>Project scope statement</h2>
        <p> The Scavenger Hunt Game that we are developing will provide the players a lot of fun during their monotonous leisure time. If the game is played in a large circle across the city, the players are encouraged to travel to different locations. This game can also be used at school as an extracurricular activity for pupils, providing them with delight and entertainment. </p>
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ul><li>A QR code and NFC tag-based scavenger hunt game website and mobile application.</li>
            <li>A programme which will convert the beacons into QR codes and NFC tags as per host selection.</li>
            <li>A programme which allows the user to use the camera and NFC feature of the device to scan QR codes and NFC tags.</li>
            <li>Access to the city map and location of the beacons and the players.</li>
            <li>A strong database management system to manage the user's personal details and location.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limits: -</h2>
        <ul><li>Cheating in our game is very easy; if someone takes a photo of the QR code and sends it to the player, he may scan it and easily win.</li>
            <li>There may be a lack of database administration of QR codes and NFC tags.</li>
            <li>Players will have a significant chance of scanning a malicious QR code or tapping on harmful NFC tags, resulting in device software damage, data leak of the user or application crash.</li>
            <li>If the host creates an NFC tags game, players who do not have an NFC capable phone will be unable to participate.</li>
            <li>If the host creates an NFC tags game, players who do not have an NFC capable phone will be unable to participate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>For our project, there are tools and technologies that are split between developers and end users. For developers of this project, there are three main technologies that will be used which are QR Codes, NFC Tags and Progressive Web Applications. Lets dive a bit deeper into the three technologies.  </p>

        <h2>QR Codes</h2>
        <p>To start off, everyone has probably heard of QR Codes, and in these modern pandemic times, everyone has also hopefully scanned at least one as well. In essence, QR codes is an advanced barcode that comes in the form of a square. It is capable of storing larger amounts of information within a combination of pixels in a square grid. It can also be generated very easily at no cost and as such using QR codes for our project would be very feasible. It can also be read and interpreted quite easily with any modern-ish mobile device, making it a simple process for end users. </p>

        <h2>NFC Tags</h2>
        <p>Next we have NFC tags. Although not as prominent as QR codes, NFC tags are still also widely used in society. NFC tags essentially allow communication between a tag and reader that are within close proximity of each other. The use of these tags are more convenient and versatile as compared to QR codes, as all it requires is a tap on a device compared to having to open up an app and manually scan the QR code. NFC Tags also can be programmed quite easily with the use of an Android or iOS device. As such, using NFC tags for this project can be a more secure option, however it costs money (although not very expensive). </p>

        <h2>Progressive Web Applications</h2>
        <p>The use of QR codes and NFC tags can pose large security issues. Who is to say that a random person with malicious intent cannot just generate a random QR code, posing as one that is generated as part of our game, and have it linked to some sort of malware. Furthermore, in the same sense a random person can also program their own NFC tags once again disguised as one created from our game, and have it steal the end users personal information. This is where progressive web applications come into play. PWAs are a cross between a web and native installed application. Because of that, it takes many advantages from both, and mashes them together to create a better application. To address the security issue, we use  PWAs because it enforces the HTTPs web protocol which ensures that any data stored on the application is secure and not tampered with. Also when using PWA, end users are ensured that they are accessing the real game, and not something malicious generated by a random person. As developers, we will be using Bootstrap Studio 6.0.1 to create the PWA which can then be accessed through a web browser, or a mobile application. </p>

        <h2>Prior Experience within Group</h2>
        <p>Within our group, experience with technologies lie mainly with the use of QR codes as expected. Additionally, everyone also has experience with NFC tags in debit/credit cards, using it for contactless payments. As for Progressive Web Applications and using Bootstrap Studio, only Sanchit has experience in it. As for the rest of us, it would be a new skill to learn. </p>

        <h1>Testing </h1>
        <p>How will your test your project? How will you know when you have succeeded? Testing is not something that you should leave until the very end; often it is far more useful to have a quick and dirty “mock up" of a project and then do some (limited) testing, to and out whether you are building the right product. If your project involves user testing, you should describe in your plan how you will find the test users, approximately what number of people you will need, and what background (if any) is required. At least one paragraph is expected here.</p>

        <h1>Timeframe </h1>
        <p>Another difficult aspect of project planning is knowing how much time to allow. You will have something like 36 hours per person for this assignment. In order to develop a plan for further work beyond the end of this course, let us assume that you will have an extra 10 hours per week per person for 10 weeks in addition to this time in order to develop your project. This means that you will have six weeks (Weeks 7 to 12) of the semester to work on your assignment, with a further 10 weeks after that. This means that your plan will be for a total of 15 weeks, with the first 6 being on this assignment</p>
        <p> You will clearly not have the extra 10 weeks to work on the project; this is intended to give you a feeling for how much you would be able to achieve in that time. This means that the first 6 weeks of your timeline will end up being your actually progress on this project, with the remaining 10 weeks being your plan for the next stages. </p>
        <p> This should be presented in the form of a table, with one row for each week, specifying as best you can the work for each person for each week. This means that the first six rows of the table will describe your progress so far, and the remaining 10 your best guess at how the remaining time would work. </p>
        <p> This will no doubt change as you work on your assignment, as it will give you a more precise idea about how long it will take to get things done. This is not an unchangeable contract for exactly how things will work; that is unrealistic for just about any project. The idea is to get you thinking about how exactly your time should be allocated to the various tasks involved. It is a good idea to have a milestone (i.e. a specific outcome) for each week of the project. This may include getting familiar with tools, or reading up on a particular technique or technology. You should also include time for writing up the final report and Page 7 of 12 any other documentation. Writing reports always takes longer than you think, especially as you should expect to re-write any piece of writing that you do at least three or four times. </p>

        <h1> Risks </h1>
        <p>What risks can you identify for your project? There will always be some generic risks (such as computers breaking down the night before a deadline, health and family issues, and institutional changes). Do not include generic risks such as these. The idea is to be as specific as you can to your project. For example, if your topic is to develop a game, there may be a risk that the software you choose to work with may be very difficult to learn, poorly documented, or not turn out to have the features that it claims it has. These properties are often only discovered once you have started working with the software, and so unless you have had lots of experience with the particular tool, there is always a risk that it may not work as well as you believe it should, no matter how much prior research you do. Similar comments apply to hardware.</p>

        <h1>Group Processes And Communications </h1>
        <p>Communication between group members is arguably the most important aspect of your project. Past experience has shown that communication breakdowns between group members is the most common cause of project failures, so it is vital that you specify at the outset the means and expected frequency of communication between group members. How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ... ?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? You should expect contact between group members at least twice a week. You can always make contact more often if you wish, but you do need to know what minimum frequency is expected from all members of your group. At least one paragraph is expected here. </p>

    <div class="card" id="introduction">
        <h1><b> Group Reflection</b></h1>

        <p>Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in this assignment. You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes (such as commit trails from GitHub, or project meeting minutes). Each member of the group should contribute up to 200 words about their own perception of the group, and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words. This should include the following attributes.
        <p> - What went well </p>
<p> - What could be improved </p>
<p>- At least one thing that was surprising</p>
<p>- At least one thing that you have learned about groups</p>
<p>- Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</p>
