        <h1><b>Project Description</b></h1>

        <p>Having completed both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, you will have thought about a personal project as well
            as one with your group. In this Assignment you are to come up with a plan for group project, and to develop
            it as much as possible in the time available. Naturally you will be very unlikely to complete your project;
            in fact, most worthwhile projects are “endless”, in that there is always more that you can do, more features
            to be added, more levels to be designed, or new devices that could be used. Naturally the choice of what to
            do is up to you, but you should take the following into account when making your decision.
        <p> - The passions, interests and skills of your group</p>
        <p>- IT industry trends</p>
        <p>- What would assist you in your career plan</p>
        <p>- Feedback from Assignments 1 and 2</p>
        <p>Your group will have developed some ideas in Assignment 2; it is fine to build on and refine these for this
            assignment, or to develop a new project based on feedback and/or what you have learned since.</p>
        </p>

    <div class="card" id="introduction">
        <h1><b> Overview </b></h1>
        <h1> Topic </h1>
        <p> We intend to develop a webpage and a phone application that will allow users to print QR codes or write NFC
            tags to aid in a treasure hunt, it concurrently also be called a scavenger hunt. The host can configure the
            game in a variety of settings, such as allocating players to teams o enabling beacons, which will be able to
            construct a specific number of them, which the computer will then translate into QR codes or similarly allow
            the host to put onto NFC tags, to be obtained in a specific order. The champion will be then contacted, and
            the presenter will be able to witness all of the progression on their tablet. </p>
        <p> If this project is successful, primary/secondary schools and event organisers will be able to quickly set up
            a treasure hunt game. It will save them a lot of time because they only need to do a little physical labour
            to put it up, and for public games, the general public will get to experience intriguing QR codes that guide
            them around areas, however scanning a random QR code is worrying, as this could lead into an induvial such
            as a hacker getting access to the person’s phone who scanned the QR code, however we are trying our best to
            help our participants to only scan the correct QR codes. If government put up a game that encompasses a
            city, it can result in significant participation within the area, particularly among visitors. </p>

        </p>
        <h1> Motivation </h1>
        <p> As a group and as a collective, our motivation behind this project is to get primary and secondary school
            children and also adults to become more physically active, as this project will help primary and secondary
            school children and adults to go out of their comfort zone and the comfort of their home and become more
            competitive, hence making anyone who participates more physically active. This project, from our group’s
            perspective, is interesting and important because of a few reasons, which are as follow: a QR code treasure
            hunt is essentially an exerciser that you can utilise inspire children or adults to be active while locating
            QR codes concealed across for example school, classroom, or local neighbourhood and secondly, scavenger
            hunts are popular amongst youngsters in schools, business offices, celebrations, and promotional events. It
            is also utilised as an orientation exerciser, team-building event, and professional engagement tool, in
            addition to being a fun game. When talking about how our fun and enjoyable game fits within the current IT
            trends, it can be said that whenever an individual or a visitor enters a building or a premises, they have
            to scan a QR code to ‘check in’, signifying the relation of it to the current IT.
        </p>
        <h1> Landscape </h1>
        <p>There are countless similar systems or products which are out there in the world which are available to the
            world, which are very closely aligned with our game, but saying that, our game is/will be extremely unique
            when compared to other similar games. Out in the real world, there are several competitors, which a bonus to
            every business, as that allows every company to outwork the other company, hence making technology more
            advanced. Our competitors include: Beaconstac’s QR Code solution, QR-Code-generator, QR Code Monkey,
            Scanova, the-qrcode-generator, GoQR, Shopify’s QR code generator and QR Stuff. When it comes to talking
            about points of differences there are about our project when compared to what exist now, it can be said that
            the project is very similar to what already exists in world, as there are already existing games which are
            based of scanning QR Codes and revolved around it being a scavenger hunt. The stuff that’s out in the world,
            the main difference between our project and the projects which already exists is the way they operate their
            game, as they way other competitors run their game.
