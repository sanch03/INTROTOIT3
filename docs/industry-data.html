        <h1><b>Our Groups Ideal Jobs</b></h1>

        <p>Let’s commence this by talking about the Job Titles which our group members in future want to be a part of,
            which include: cyber security, app developer, full stack developer, mobile app developer, Senior Systems
            Administrator, software engineer and senior cyber security officer. The Job Titles mentioned before would be
            ranked quite high, as the demand for cyber security, according to Cybersecuirty Workforce Study 2021 from
            industry group the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, it’s predicted that
            jobs in 2023 are about to go up by 23%. Two of our group members would be enevoled in cybersecurity, as
            Pratham and Jack both desired to work in that field in IT. Additionally, according to Australia’s
            cybersecurity Future’s by Frank Smith, Aim Sinpeng, Ralph Holz, Sarah Logan, Jonathon Hutchinson and Hui Xue
            suggests that jobs in cybersecurity between the years of 2023 and 2024 are expected to go up by 3%, and they
            also say that it will most likely increase than decrease.
            <br>Moving onto talking about software engineering, as most of technology in this century and generation
            requires top tier software, as it is required to several tasks on a daily basis. Software Engneering’s
            future demand, according to Job Outlook by the Australian government, is described as “very strong”.
            According to the National Skills Commission Skills Priority List, software engineering would be considered
            as in a “Strong” demand in Victoria and all around Australia. Additionally, ‘Futures Platform’ suggests that
            software engineering jobs are expected to “grow at a rate of 24%” between the years of 2016 and 2026.
            Furthermore, jobs are expected to increase by 22% from 2020 to 2030.</br>
            <br>Moving on, Sanchit is an individual who stands out from the group and has a very unique and specific Job
            Title, which is to be a Senior Systems Administrator. According to Job Outlook by the Australian Government,
            the “future growth” for a Systems Adminstrator’s job title is described as “strong”. Additionally, to
            Pluralsight, by 2020, demand for network and computer systems administrators is predicted to increase by up
            to 28%. Furthermore, if we search systems administrator as a job title on job seek, it showcases us 3453
            total jobs all around australia, which is obsered.</br>
            <br>Danieal and Vivek are individuals whose’s Job Titles are parallel to each other, which is being involved
            in development of apps, which includes mobile and web. Applications are extremely necessary and are used
            very often on a daily basis, hence their job demands will be strong and high in demand. According to
            studyworkgrow, app developers are “higher than average demand in…Victoria and…”. Furthermore, ‘Mobile App
            Daily’, “the demand for the number of developers is expected to increase from 17% to 24% by the year 2026”.
            Strolling through various websites and articles, it can be said that app developers are in reality actually
            not that much in demand, as apps these days can be made on other platforms without the need to use computer
            programming.</br>
            <br>Lastly, Clinton is an individual who seems to be extremely interested in the Job Title ‘Full Stack
            Developer’, which according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is “one of the highest paying jobs
            worldwide”. Furthermore, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Full Stack Development positions are expected
            to grow from 135,000 to over 853,000 by 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Full-stack
            development jobs are high-paying occupations that are accessible in big numbers. Additionally, burning glass
            data suggest that there were 344 job postings, hence showcasing its job demand.</br>

        <h1><b>Our Groups Required Skillset</b></h1>
        <h2><b>
                <Font size="06">How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from
                    employers?
            </b></h2>
        <p>As Sanchit is the most experienced and well pronounced when it comes to experience, among the group, Sanchit
            will most likely be accepted into a job according to his desires. When it comes to IT-specific skills, he
            has most of them covered, such as programming, data analysis and security. According to burning glass data,
            there were 3570 job postings which required IT-specific skills of being able to use the programming language
            SQL, which Sanchit knows well, as he does Practical Database Concepts, which revolves around using SQL
            programming. Hence, meaning that his skill set will be ranked quite high, as additionally he also knows
            JavaScript and Java, as burning glass once again suggests that there were 2946 job postings for JavaScript
            and 2699 for Java. Therefore, making his skill set rank even higher in terms of demand for employers,meaning
            company’s will prefer him over someone who lacks experience in the required IT-specific skills.
            <br>When it comes to IT-specific skills, Navdeep has a few covered, which include programming and Data
            Analysis. As Navdeep does Intro to Programming, which heavily uses the programming language Python to code,
            he skill set may or may not rank quite high in terms of demand from employers. According to burning glass
            data, when it came to IT-specific skills, Python had 1150 job postings, as this suggests that not a lot of
            jobs require Python as an IT-specific skill. Hence making Navdeep’s skill set rank quite low, as there are
            not a lot of job postings. Moving on, he also knows the programming language called SQL. As burning glass
            data demonstrated that there were 3750 job postings for the IT-specific skill of SQL, hence may make
            Navdeep’s skill set rank a bit higher in terms of demand from employers, as there were quite a lot of job
            postings.</br>
            <br>Moving on, Pratham like Sanchit and Navdeep and everyone in the group does Intro to Programming and
            Practical Database Concepts, which give him experience in the programming languages which go by the name of
            ‘Python’ and ‘SQL’. When it comes to SQL, Pratham skill set rank high in terms of demand from employers, as
            there were 3750 job postings for the IT-specific skill of SQL, hence may make Navdeep’s skill set rank a bit
            higher in terms of demand from employers, as there were quite a lot of job postings. Concurrently, his skill
            set may also rank quite low, as Python is a programming language which did not have great amounts of job
            postings, it only had 1150 job postings. Therefore, making Pratham’s skill set rank in the middle in terms
            of demands from employers.</br>
            <br>As Vivek wants to be an app developer in the future, he would need to have the T-specific skill of
            Graphic designing, as it is essential when it comes to developing apps. As of now, his skill set would rank
            in the middle, as he is in the same boat as Pratham and Navdeep. According to statistics from Burning Glass,
            Python had 1150 job posts when it came to IT-specific talents, indicating that not many positions demand
            Python as an IT-specific expertise. As a result, Jack’s skill set is ranked fairly low, as there aren't many
            employment openings. Moving on, he also understands SQL, a computer language. Because there were 3750 job
            listings for the IT-specific talent of SQL, Jack’s skill set may score a little higher in terms of demand
            from employers, given the large number of job postings.</br>
            <br>When it comes to IT-specific skills, Jack, just like everyone else in the group, except Sanchit, would
            rank somewhere in the middle, as he is the same as everyone. Python had 1150 job listings when it came to
            IT-specific abilities, according to information from Burning Glass, showing that not many opportunities
            require Python as an IT-specific competence. As a result, Jack’s skill set is ranked low since there are few
            job vacancies. Moving on, he is also familiar with SQL, a programming language. Given the vast amount of job
            posts for the IT-specific ability of SQL, Jack’s skill set may rank a little better in terms of demand from
            employers.</br>
            <br>Moving on, let’s commence talking about Danieal’s skill set in terms of demand from employers.
            Concurring
            to burning glass information, when it came to IT-specific abilities, Python had 1150 work postings, as this
            proposes that not a parcel of employment requires Python as an IT-specific aptitude. Subsequently making
            Danieal's aptitude set rank very good, as there are not a part of work postings. Moving on, he too knows the
            programming dialect called SQL. As burning glass information illustrated that there were 3750 work postings
            for the IT-specific aptitude of SQL, subsequently may make Danieal's aptitude set rank a bit higher in terms
            of request from bosses, as there were very few work postings.</br>
            <br>Lastly, Clinton, just like the others in the group, except Sanchit, is in the boat, as everyone does the
            same course. Agreeing to consuming glass data, when it came to IT-explicit capacities, Python had 1150 work
            postings, as this recommends that not a bundle of business requires Python as an IT-explicit fitness. In
            this manner making Clinton’s inclination set rank awesome, as there are not a piece of work postings.
            Continuing on, he also knows the programming vernacular called SQL. As consuming glass data represented that
            there were 3750 work postings for the IT-explicit inclination of SQL, in this way might make Clinton’s
            fitness set rank a piece higher concerning demand from managers, as there were not very many work
            postings.</br>
