        <h1> Team Name </h1>
        <p> TUE #14 - The Back Table </p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
        <p> Welcome to The Back Table's wonderful website. Hope is all well and we hope you enjoy our website. The team,
            Sanchit, Clinton, Pratham, Daniel, Vivek, Jack and Navdeep have done their best to comeplete this website to
            the best of their abiltities. This website includes: Team Profile(introduction to every group member and a
            little insight about iur team's life), project plan, skills and jobs, detailed description about our project
            and group reflection. </p>


        <h1> Group Process </h1>
        <p> In assignment two “THE Back Table” performed extremely well in teamwork and never lacked in helping other
            members out when they needed some assistance. The group also split up work evenly so one person did not have
            to contribute to doing majority of the work all by themselves. Overall, as this was the first assignment for
            this course for all the members, everyone performed extremely well. As for making any changes within the
            group, members have decided to participate and put a greater effort within the team meetings, so we do not
            have to call every few times a week but rather do it occasionally with greater effort. </p>

        <h1> Carrer Plans </h1>
        <p> Let’s commence this by talking about the Job Titles which our group members in future want to be a part of,
            which include: cyber security, app developer, full stack developer, mobile app developer, Senior Systems
            Administrator, software engineer and senior cyber security officer. The Job Titles mentioned before would be
            ranked quite high, as the demand for cyber security, according to Cybersecuirty Workforce Study 2021 from
            industry group the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, it’s predicted that
            jobs in 2023 are about to go up by 23%. Two of our group members would be enveloped in cybersecurity, as
            Pratham and Jack both desired to work in that field in IT. Additionally, according to Australia’s
            cybersecurity Future’s by Frank Smith, Aim Sinpeng, Ralph Holz, Sarah Logan, Jonathon Hutchinson and Hui Xue
            suggests that jobs in cybersecurity between the years of 2023 and 2024 are expected to go up by 3%, and they
            also say that it will most likely increase than decrease. Moving onto talking about software engineering, as
            most of technology in this century and generation requires top tier software, as it is required to several
            tasks on a daily basis. Software Engneering’s future demand, according to Job Outlook by the Australian
            government, is described as “very strong”. According to the National Skills Commission Skills Priority List,
            software engineering would be considered as in a “Strong” demand in Victoria and all around Australia.
            Additionally, ‘Futures Platform’ suggests that software engineering jobs are expected to “grow at a rate of
            24%” between the years of 2016 and 2026. Furthermore, jobs are expected to increase by 22% from 2020 to
            2030. </p>
        <p> Moving on, Sanchit is an individual who stands out from the group and has a very unique and specific Job
            Title, which is to be a Senior Systems Administrator. According to Job Outlook by the Australian Government,
            the “future growth” for a Systems Adminstrator’s job title is described as “strong”. Additionally, to
            Pluralsight, by 2020, demand for network and computer systems administrators is predicted to increase by up
            to 28%. Furthermore, if we search systems administrator as a job title on job seek, it showcases us 3453
            total jobs all around australia, which is obsered. </p>
        <p> Danieal and Vivek are individuals whose’s Job Titles are parallel to each other, which is being involved in
            development of apps, which includes mobile and web. Applications are extremely necessary and are used very
            often on a daily basis, hence their job demands will be strong and high in demand. According to
            studyworkgrow, app developers are “higher than average demand in...Victoria and...”. Furthermore, ‘Mobile
            App Daily’, “the demand for the number of developers is expected to increase from 17% to 24% by the year
            2026”. Strolling through various websites and articles, it can be said that app developers are in reality
            actually not that much in demand, as apps these days can be made on other platforms without the need to use
            computer programming. </p>
        <p> Lastly, Clinton is an individual who seems to be extremely interested in the Job Title ‘Full Stack
            Developer’, which according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is “one of the highest paying jobs
            worldwide”. Furthermore, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Full Stack Development positions are expected
            to grow from 135,000 to over 853,000 by 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Full-stack
            development jobs are high-paying occupations that are accessible in big numbers. Additionally, burning glass
            data suggest that there were 344 job postings, hence showcasing its job demand. </p>
