        <img src="img/sanchit.jpg" alt="" width="200px" id="picofme">
        <p><strong>Student Number: </strong>s3949232</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong> I love Minecraft </p>
        <p><strong>Email: </strong><a href="mailto:S3949232@student.rmit.edu.au">S3949232@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>

        <br><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>About:</h2>

        <p> Sanchit was born in New Delhi, India and moved to Australia in 2008. He loves anything and everything to do
            with technology. His I.T experience started beginning in his early school days when he would mess with batch
            files and VBScript and he was also using infamous programs such as the classic auto disk drive opener which
            eventually ended grabbing teachers' attention and got him in some trouble. His main hobbies are playing
            games like Terraria and Minecraft which he invests a lot of time in. A really interesting fact about Sanchit
            is that he can wiggle his ears without touching them and only about 10-20% of the population can do this.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Profile:</h2>
        <p> Sanchit did 3 tests which were the Myers-Briggs test, Learning Style Test and Divergent Association Test. In
            the first test Sanchit was proven to be 52% introverted, 66% observant, 64% thinking, 75% prospecting and
            54% turbulent. In the learning style test he was found to be 43% kinesthetic, 35% visual based and 22%
            auditory. Lastly in Divergent association test which measures verbal creativity and involves thinking of
            unrelated ideas and people who are more creative tend to think of ideas with greater distances between them,
            Sanchit scored higher than 63.04% of the people who took this test in the past and scored a total of 80.022.
        </p>

        <p> Overall from all these test results with Sanchits great creativity and observant skills found in the first
            and third test, it can really help bring the team together and also help keep everyone together as one. From
            the second test we can see that his main learning style is throught kinesthetic which can help the group
            understand him more because most people prefer explanations through physical actions rather than watching
            videos like online lectures. </p>

            in Moradabad city in Utter Pradesh state of India in 2001. Something interesting about Vivek is that he

            observant, 71% feeling, 67% judging anf 54% assertive. This suggest like other members in the group Vivek is
            a very energetic person and with his extraverted nature in a team he would be very useful as he has the
            capability to boost everyone energy if they are tired. In the second test Viveks learning style is the
            highest in ‘Visual’ with a rating of 45% and if anybody in the group struggles to understand his work or

            imagery. Lastly in the big 5 personality test Vivek got the highest rating in the conscientiousness, which
            basically mean Vivek will always do his part in the group with great accuracy and thoroughly. In comparison

            important factor due to if the team is ever feeling down both these people will make sure you’re alright and
            give you a hand. </p>

        <p> My name is Navdeep Singh Ghuman, I prefer to go by the name Nav. I was born and raised in India and came to
            Australia permanently in late 2015 to continue studying. I come from northern India, from the state of
            Punjab. At home the most spoken language would be Punjabi, and English as well, but Punjabi would dominantly
            be spoken. Growing up I always wanted to be a part of aviation, being a pilot in either the air force or
            being a commercial pilot for any airline company. But one day in my elective class, I was taught coding
            (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), ever since I have fallen in love with coding and amazingly how it runs our
            computers and technology overall. In my free time I like to learn coding (as programming languages are
            revolving every single day, currently learning JavaScript and Java), hit up the gym, play a lot of
            Basketball, perform Muay Thai and boxing. Another interesting fact about me would be that I use to be a Sue
            Chef in a professional restaurant, working under my mother who was a Head Chef in that workplace.My name is

        <h2>Personal Profile:</h2>

        <p> On Nav's personality test he got, 67% extraverted, 52% observant and 59% feeling. With these results just
            like everyone else in this group he is a very unique and honorable member as with his personality he never
            fails to make other laugh due to his extravertness. Following up on the learning style test he received, 35%
            auditory, visual of 35% and tactile 30%. Navs strongest points are auditory and visual and with this style
            he can help out in team discussions as he would always be listening to what other have to say and thus would
            input in matter when needed. Lastly in his personality trait test, he got the highest in category “A” which
            represents agreeableness and this is very true as he always agrees with his team members and never tries to
            state that what he says is always right but instead prefers others opinions. </p>
