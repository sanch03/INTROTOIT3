        <p> Sanchit was born in New Delhi, India and moved to Australia in 2008. He loves anything and everything to do
            with technology. His I.T experience started beginning in his early school days when he would mess with batch
            files and VBScript and he was also using infamous programs such as the classic auto disk drive opener which
            eventually ended grabbing teachers' attention and got him in some trouble. His main hobbies are playing
            games like Terraria and Minecraft which he invests a lot of time in. A really interesting fact about Sanchit
            is that he can wiggle his ears without touching them and only about 10-20% of the population can do this.

        <p> Another exciting member of "The Back Table" is Clinton whose student ID is s3840992, he was originally born
            and raised in the Suburb of Mangere which is located in Auckland, New Zealand. Clinton interestingly also
            has Vietnamese and Chinese blood flowing right through his veins and can speak English, Teochew and
            Vietnamese. Clinton's interest in I.T comes from his uncle who introduced him to gaming at an early age and
            from there on he had a great interest in I.T and he was also known as the “I.T guy” in his family and friend
            group. Clinton eventually decided to take Units 1-4 of Software Engineering, where he learnt how to code in
            Java and followed the software engineering process to create his own basic software which wasn’t the best
            but he learned a lot. In Clinton's spare time he likes to play CS:GO, Valorant, basketball and also likes to
            workout. </p>

        <p> My name is Navdeep Singh Ghuman, I prefer to go by the name Nav. I was born and raised in India and came to
            Australia permanently in late 2015 to continue studying. I come from northern India, from the state of
            Punjab. At home the most spoken language would be Punjabi, and English as well, but Punjabi would dominantly
            be spoken. Growing up I always wanted to be a part of aviation, being a pilot in either the air force or
            being a commercial pilot for any airline company. But one day in my elective class, I was taught coding
            (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), ever since I have fallen in love with coding and amazingly how it runs our
            computers and technology overall. In my free time I like to learn coding (as programming languages are
            revolving every single day, currently learning JavaScript and Java), hit up the gym, play a lot of
            Basketball, perform Muay Thai and boxing. Another interesting fact about me would be that I use to be a Sue
            Chef in a professional restaurant, working under my mother who was a Head Chef in that workplace.My name is
