        <h1>interview feedback</h1>
        <p>In order to help us to have a better understanding about the IT industry, we invite an IT professional named
            Eric Zhang who works at Coles to tell us about his work experience. Interviewing an IT professional will
            expose
            our biases and ignorance. More than anything else, interviewing them will show us about what IT works looks
            like.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="card" id="workdone">
        <h2>What has been done by the IT professional?</h2>
        <p>Eric tells us that he is a Systems Engineer at End User Computing 3rd level support. His main role in his
            work is to
            look after IT projects from end users’ perspective end to end. And also tech support. Other than that, Eric
            will look
            after all the audiovisual requirements in Coles because his main areas of focus are IPTel and AV. He
            supports all
            collaboration and audio-visual requirements within the company and also does general desktop support for
            c-suit executives.
            The aspects of his work that he spends most of time on is project management, that will be project planning,
            budgets within
            the project, timelines and also resources for the project, such as equipment, people and all other stuff
            relative to the
            project. And his deliverable is generally system design and implementation tasks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="interact">
        <h2>The people they interact with</h2>
        <p>Interacting with other people is often required in Eric's work. Typically they cover all areas of the
            business. Starting
            from the business sponsor who’s funding the project, the external vendors who participate in the project and
            provide the
            hardware support and help with the design. At the sametime, he obviously needs to work with different skill
            groups to form
            a design and come up with the solution. Also, he will be interacting with all aspects of IT because they
            have multiple touch
            points in their projects. But typically the teams he works with day in day out is the network department.
            Network to IT is
            like the water to fish because everything runs on it. For Coles, they hold their own EFT, payment exchange
            and stuff like
            that. So security is also the department he is always interacting with. Other than that will be the database
            analysis pool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" id="mainwork">
        <h2>The main work</h2>
        <p>After analysing the responses of the interviewee, I discovered that IT workers spend the majority of their
            time doing work
            about work, such as contacting someone about plans or doing practical, non-creative chores like
            micro-managing others.I also
            came to the conclusion that most IT personnel spend relatively little time doing skill-based tasks. IT
            professionals spend a
            portion of their time in meetings with co-workers. I also came to the conclusion that IT professionals love
            their jobs, participate
            in enjoyable activities with their co-workers, enjoy their work time, and prepare coffee in their spare
            time. IT employees waste a
            significant amount of time at work on tasks that are unrelated to their job function, greatly limiting their
            ability to do meaningful
            work. IT specialists contribute significantly to the firm; they prepare and make presentations, and they may
            even come up with new
            business ideas. IT workers do duties such as programming (Python, JavaScript, C++, and so on), data input,
            data management, software
            development, web development, software experimentation, software research, and so on. An IT professional's
            life is both excellent
            and awful. It's nice in the sense that he works in his office on his computer and doesn't have to perform
            any physical labour. And
            it's awful in the sense that if an IT worker has a lot of work to do and finishes it before the deadline,
            he'll have to take it home
            and finish it there, which will make his life more stressful and leave him with less time to spend with his
            family and no time to
            participate in other activities such as sports and going on outings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" id="challenging">
        <h2>Challenging</h2>
        <p>IT professional workers have many responsibilities in their job. From my previous interview with an IT
            worker, he is clearly seen as
            having several responsibilities such as Project planning, budgets, timelines and resources, system design,
            and implementation, which
            could be difficult to manage sometimes. From my interview responses, I understand that IT professionals love
            their job and enjoy what
            they do. Even though completing a project increases their satisfaction level, there are numerous challenges
            they face. After analysing
            the responses of the interviewee, I observe that IT workers are challenged with some things such as working
            with other business units
            and other parts. Since they are busy working on their position, sometimes it is difficult working on some
            parts of IT such as security,
            network, etc. Moreover, most of the time the IT professionals spent their time working on projects. Their
            excitement is after they have
            done their project so they really try to finish it early as quickly as possible, however, In a fast-moving
            project, getting timely responses
            and decisions from other teams is really challenging for them.</p>

    <div class="card" id="conclusion">
        <p>To gain a better understanding of the IT sector, we invited a Coles IT specialist to speak about professional
            career. biases and
            misunderstanding will be exposed when you consult an IT expert. Interrogating them will demonstrate you much
            about how IT functions.
            To establish a layout and find a solution, he will clearly need to collaborate with various skill teams.
            He'll also be engaging with
            all elements of IT because their plans have channels. But the network department is usually the team he
            works with on a daily basis.
            The connectivity to IT is more the same as water. IT employees spend the significant amounts of time
            undertaking work which are related,
            or performing mundane, quasi tasks. In summery many IT professionals do take minimal time performing duties
            related to their carriers.</p>
