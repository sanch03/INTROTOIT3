        <h1>Clouds, services and servers</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Cloud services </b>are any infrastructure, platforms, software, or technologies that customers may access
            through
            the internet without having to download additional programming.<br>
            <b>Cloud servers</b> function by virtualizing physical servers and making them accessible to customers in
            remote
            locations.A hypervisor is used to virtualize servers on a regular basis, although not always. The actual
            servers' process assets are then used to create and power virtual servers, often known as cloud servers.
            Associations may then connect to these virtual servers through a working web connection from any physical
            location.
        </p>
        <h2>Features provides by Cloud: -</h2>
        <p><b>Big Data Analytics: - </b>The capacity to employ huge data analysis to take advantage of enormous amounts
            of both
            structured and unstructured data to bring the benefit of identifying commercial value is one of the
            advantages
            of cloud computing.<br>
            <b>Cloud Storage: -</b> You may save your files and documents in the cloud and access, save, retrieve, and
            recover
            them from any web-enabled interface. Web administration's linking points are frequently simple. You have
            tremendous accessibility, quickness, adaptability, and security in your current scenario, whenever and
            wherever
            you are.<br>
            <b>Disaster recovery: - </b>Another benefit of using the cloud is the cost-effectiveness of a Disaster
            Recovery (DR)
            setup, which allows for faster recovery from a lattice of multiple physical locations at a significantly
            lower
            cost than a traditional DR site with fixed resources, rigid systems, and a significantly higher cost.<br>
            <b>Data Backup: -</b> You can back up your data on the cloud, which is significantly safer and more
            cost-effective,
            and you can access it from anywhere. Only one web-connected device is required.
        </p>
        <h2>Future cloud services: -</h2>
        <p><b>Increase Storage Capacity: -</b> Information is produced in large quantities nowadays, and keeping it
            safely is
            difficult. The majority of businesses require a secure location to keep their data. Cloud computing is being
            used
            by a large number of businesses.<br>
            <b>Enhanced Performance of Internet: -</b> The nature of the web may be broadened with the help of the
            Internet of
            Things (IoT). With the help of the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing, we may save data in the cloud for
            further
            research and better execution.<br>
            <b>Improvement in Cloud Services: -</b> With this help, we will be able to achieve our ideal goals. Many
            experts
            have predicted that Cloud Computing would be one of the most important advancements in the future, with the
            product
            as a service arrangement accounting for more than 60% of the workload.<br>
            <b>Economic: - </b>If cloud computing continues to advance, the use of hardware will decrease since the
            majority of
            work will be completed using cloud computing and virtualization. We can reduce the cost of programming setup
            by splitting
            it, which will result in lower hardware consumption.Assuming that progress continues, the information stored
            in the cloud
            will be broken down with the help of a computer, and it will be destroyed.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies and development required: -</h2>
        <p><b>Serverless: -</b> With serverless computing, the pay-as-you-go model and pay-for-use registration models
            have tended to the
            majority of programming issues. This capacity-as-a-service paradigm made the cloud computing environment
            function faster
            and more efficiently.<br>
            <b>Microservices: - </b> Microservice design divides large applications into small, interconnected
            administrations or modules.
            This calculated technique enables the delivery of several modules by various small groups without the need
            for a true'mass'
            application. This enables the delivery of totally updated code on a regular basis, hence shortening the
            application delivery
            cycle.<br>
            <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI): - </b>The cloud plays a critical role in their development. Such businesses
            are looking towards
            Cloud for AI and other deep learning devices. Cloud-based AI is becoming as the most-looked-for solution for
            organisations
            of any size in understanding their AI endeavours, owing to its broad figuring and stockpiling options.
        </p>
        <h2>Impact of Cloud services and servers in our daily life: -</h2>
        <p>The impact of cloud computing in our day-to-day life in various ways. Some of the examples are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Social media</b> platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and many more use the
                cloud in many ways.
                The pictures we upload on any social media platform are stored in the cloud.</li>
            <li> Before cloud computing came into the image, we used to watch our favourite shows on the TV or listen to
                the shows which
                circulated on the radio. Cloud has brought a revolution to the <b>Entertainment</b> industry.
                Cloud-based applications such as
                Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify and many more deliver us entertainment content. We can stream movies,
                shows and music
                anytime and from anywhere with the internet.</li>
            <li><b>Shopping</b> is also affected by the revolution of the cloud. Amazon, eBay and many more apps use the
                cloud for providing
                an online shopping experience.</li>
            <li>In <b>Hospitals</b> and Healthcare specialist organizations specialists use cloud-based patient entries
                where significant
                wellbeing information is open and computerized records of patients are put away in the cloud.</li>
            <li>Universities are now providing online <b>Education</b> courses all over the world. The learning material
                is also stored in the
                cloud and can be easily accessible.</li>
            <li><b>Communication</b> tools, for example, messages, informing and calling applications like Gmail,
                WhatsApp, and Skype depending
                on the cloud framework.</li>
            <li><b>Impact of Cloud Computing On the Workforce: -</b> Cloud services are used by many businesses, and
                they have opened up several
                prospects for them. Because of a lack of awareness and anxiety about job cuts in the IT workforce,
                acceptance of cloud computing
                was a little delayed. Cloud services aid in the creation of a virtual working environment in which
                several programmes and
                administrations may be managed from a single location. Employees may access the workplace from anywhere
                in the globe and at
                any time if they have access to a web network. As a result, the cloud facilitates working and has aided
                representatives' job
                efficiency. The cloud allows for a more productive working environment and for employees to be assigned
                to the appropriate
                tasks and duties.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Impact of cloud in my life: -</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud assumes a huge part in my life, presently I can store my pictures and records on the cloud on stages
            like google one drive and
            Apple iCloud. Cloud likewise help me in saving my gadget stockpiling as the greater part of my information
            is put away in the cloud
            so my capacity is free and my gadget even works quicker. With the assistance of the cloud, I can get my
            information from any place
            and any spot and whenever. Beforehand to take my information someplace I needed to convey my PC or duplicate
            my information into a
            pen drive and afterwards no one but I can take my information someplace, yet presently with the assistance
            of the cloud, I simply
            need to transfer my information on the cloud and afterwards I can get to it from anyplace.

            I'm additionally interested in video games yet I don't have a PC to run very good quality games and here
            comes cloud gaming which
            gives a stage to play any top of the line game without installing it into your gadget, you simply need to
            have a quick internet
            connection and you can stream any game whenever in any gadget. This cloud service helps me the most.

            Cloud additionally influence my family members in various ways, the vast majority of my family members
            utilize the cloud for putting
            away their photographs on google photos or iCloud. And furthermore, they use to stream films and shows on
            Netflix, Amazon Prime and
            many more. In my family, everybody loves music and the cloud gives magnificent music real-time features on
            applications like Spotify,
            iTunes and some more.

            This is about my involvement with utilizing clouds services and how the cloud transforms me.

    <div class="card" id="languageprocessing">
        <h1>Language Processing</h1>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>The Human Language is filled with many odd structures that may be specific to cultures, religions or
            even small groups of friends. A great example of which is the use of sarcasm mainly in the English language
            which is the usage of irony to make fun of an idea. Although widely used in the western world, Japan
            is a country in which their language does not have sarcasm. As such, when an attempt of sarcasm is voiced
            to a Japanese person, they will take the meaning literally which can come across as offensive. In essence,
            different languages have different structures such as: metaphors, similes, homonyms, homophones, idioms and
            grammar that makes it difficult for computers to process. As a result, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was
            developed to try and solve the issue. NLP is the use of Artificial Intelligence to allow computers to
            understand languages as if they were human. NLP uses computing technologies such as machine learning and
            deep
            learning models to enable computers to process human texts or voice data. Currently, NLP is being used for
            various different technologies. For example, a large use of NLP is the technology of Spam Detection. The way
            it works is that NLP would scan emails or texts for common language (bad grammar, overuse of financial
            terms,
            misspelt names, etc) that would indicate that it is a phishing or scam scheme. Another prominent technology
            that uses NLP is translation services. For example, Google Translate uses NLP to obviously translate
            languages,
            but the translation also has to be accurate. It has to capture the correct meaning by accurately
            transferring
            over the matching tones as well. In a few years time, NLP can be used to further improve existing personal
            assistants such as Google, Alexa or Siri. It may be possible to develop a human-like personal assistant such
            as
            Jarvis from Iron Man where he is able to communicate like a human, with Tony Stark and assist him with daily
            tasks such as saving the world, rather than just being able to answer simple questions and follow basic
            tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>The development of a more advanced personal assistant, one that can communicate to humans as if it were
            another human, would change a lot of things in the world. There currently already exist robots at
            restaurants
            that move around to bring food to customers as well as tablet devices to order food. With the existence of
            an advanced personal assistant, it could be installed within a robot to then be used to take orders from
            customers, deliver the food and take the empty dishes back. This would then lead to more and more
            restaurants
            requiring less employees/job opportunities and probably many redundancies. The personal assistant can also
            be
            developed to become a home robot, whereby users can use it to help them with their daily tasks at home. The
            assistant can expand and start other tasks such as creating a morning routine by not only announcing the
            weather, traffic and time, but also possibly making coffee and bringing it, or having clothes warmed up
            readily
            for the user. Although the idea is a bit far-fetched currently, it may be possible with various
            technological
            advancements in the coming years.
        </p>

        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>Currently in my daily life, I don't use personal assistants often, if not at all. As an iPhone user, I don’t
            find the need to use Siri as whatever Siri can do, I can probably also do it myself without the need to make
            it seem like I am talking to myself. As for at home, personally I do not find it necessary to have something
            like Google or Alexa to tell me the weather, traffic or time as I can do that all very quickly with my
            mobile
            phone. However, with the development of more advanced assistants using NLP, I can see myself using these
            personal assistants more often. For example, I would personally have the assistant do various tasks in the
            morning before I wake up such as make coffee, prepare my clothes, turn on my computer, and set out an
            itinerary for the day by communicating the tasks to it the previous night. I would also probably have it
            prepare breakfast by telling it what I want, and have it prepare the food. The use of the personal assistant
            would help me save time in the morning, and ensure that I do not miss breakfast, as I usually would due to
            having not enough time. I would also see my family and friends possibly using a personal assistant in the
            same
            ways.

    <div class="card" id="autonomousvehicles">
        <h1>Autonomous vehicles</h1>
        <h2>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h2>
        <p>One of the main modes of transportation in society are cars. Civilisation has build roads connecting even the
            smallest towns to the largest cities, just to allow people to drive between them. Cars have served us well
            for many years, providing on demand, individual transportation. However, a system is only a good as its
            weakest link, which in todays day and age is the human driver. The human driver is not the ideal driver for
            a multiple tonne machine, as they can fall asleep, not concentrate and possibly cause car accidents. A new
            state of the art technology that can solve this problem is Autonomous Vehicles. </p>

        <p>Autonomous vehicles, in lamen terms, are vehicles that have some level of control in operating themselves.
            The car you drive today likely has atleast one feature of autonomy, such as a cruise control. There are 6
            levels of driving automation, ranging from no automation, to full automation.</p>

        <p>Level 0: No Automation
            At Level 0 the car is controlled fully manually, the driver has to perform all tasks such as steering,
            accelerating, braking, etc.</p>

        <p>Level 1: Driver Assistance
            This is the level of many cars on the road today, the vehicle has a single automated system, such as its
            cruise control.</p>

        <p>Level 2: Partial Automation
            At this level the vehicle can perform steering and acceleration, however teh human still has to constantly
            monitor the tasks and can taje control at any time.</p>

        <p>Level 3: Conditional Automation
            The vehicle can now monitor the environment, and can perform most driving tasks without human intervention.
            However, a human override is still required.</p>

        <p>Level 4: High Automation
            At this level the vehicle can perform all driving tasks, but only under specific conditions and must be
            geofenced to a certain area. A human override is optional but recommended at this level.</p>

        <p>Level 5: Full Automation
            The vehicle is able to perform all driving tasks at this stage and no human attention or interaction is
            required.
        </p>
        <p>At levels 0-2 the human has to monitor the driving environment, and at levels 3-5 the automated system is
            able to monitor the driving environment.</p>

        <p>It is considered to be extrememly difficult to achieve level 5 full automation, as there are too many catch
            cases and unpredictable environments for the systems to tackle. In an ideal world, self-driving would be
            easy, but we do not live in such a world, there are missing lane markings, broken street signs and
            unpredictable drivers that make it extremely difficult to reach such a level of autonomy.</p>

        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>The likely impact of this technology would be that it would change the way we commute forever. The people
            most affected by this would be the ones that use cars, as they will no longer have to pay attention to the
            roads and can just enjoy their commute instead of focusing on roads. If a majority of vehicles on the roads
            become autonomous, it would also make the roads alot safer, as the vehicles will be able to communicate and
            coordinate with each other. If all vehicles on the roads were autonomous there would also be reduced
            traffic, there would also be no need for physical signal lights and the vehicles would just communicate with
            each other to determine how to enter the intersection. This technology will make the jobs of taxi drivers
            redundant, as robot taxis will be able to do their job autonomously, however this technology will also
            create jobs in the IT sector for the development of better autonomous systems and constant growth. It is
            also possible that there would be no need for a drivers license for common commuters as nobody will be
            driving.</p>

        <h2>How will this affect us in the future?</h2>
        <p>This technology will affect me in the future. In the future it will be possible that I will not need to
            drive a car anywhere, it will drive itself, and additionally commute times for me would be heavily reduced.
            The price for a taxi would also be likely reduced. It will affect ym family and friends in simmilar ways, we
            will not need to pay attention to the roads and can do other stuff while the car drives, additionally making
            use more productive aswell.</p>

        <h1>Robots</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Robots are a type of automated machine that can do some specific tasks with or without human help. A specific
            field called robotics deals with robots’ design and operation.
            Fundamentally, there are many various types of robots as there are different tasks to be performed by them.
            Robots can perform some tasks better than humans. For example, they can better do;
            · Process and deliver reports for enterprise security.
            · Assisting during difficulties such as emergencies and surgeries.
            · Work in an unforeseeable or dangerous environment.
            · They can also work for entertainment with movies and other activities.
            The new era of robotics helps in areas such as law enforcement, weather forecasts, military, and management.
            Robots are poised to disable millions of humans in different industries. There is a fear that machines
            replace humans as the dominant intelligence on the planet. The robotic industry keeps innovating, combining
            artificial intelligence to produce a new better version.
            The robotic industry is releasing more human-like cognitive abilities and in some cases, appearance in the
            future. For example, a robot can pick like a champ. They also are even starting to perform functions that
            have been done by humans like making coffee, ferrying toilet paper, caring elderly and other tasks.
            Since the innovation of robots is greatly developing, many human jobs will be taken over by robots such as:
            telemarketing, sewer management, automated shipping services, data entry work, librarians and library
            technicians, photograph processing, and others.

        </p>
        <h2>Automated Shipping Services</h2>
        <p>Most organizations are anticipated to use automated shipping services in the near future, putting those who
            work in shipping factories and enterprises out of work. People will no longer be required to handle
            shipping; instead, computers and robots will be used to manage the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Entry Work</h2>
        <p>Individual data entry labor, whether done at work or at home, is expected to become obsolete in the near
            future. Robots are likely to be trained to take over traditional data entry labor and responsibilities,
            making it increasingly difficult for people with years of experience in the industry to find work that pays
            well. Because software programs, tools, and eventually robots may be able to accomplish any data entry jobs
            that are accessible, demand for human people will decline, causing the work to be worthless overall.
        </p>

        <h2>Tax Prepares</h2>
        <p>Tax preparers may no longer be working with clients as tax season approaches. Instead, the usage of internet
            and offline software packages has made tax preparation easier than ever. Not only will using tax preparation
            software and online services save you time, but it will also save you money compared to visiting a local tax
            preparation specialist or professional. Most tax-filing services will certainly become available to anybody
            with an Internet connection in the future, rendering tax preparation roles essentially obsolete.
        </p>

        <h2>Library and Library Technicians</h2>
        <p>Anyone working at a public or city library now may find themselves unemployed in the next few decades. With
            the installation of automatic technologies to track books and users who are using their library cards at all
            times, library technicians may no longer be required. In the future, libraries may operate in a more
            high-tech fashion, with digital checkouts eliminating the need for a professional library technician on hand
            to assist.
        </p>

        <h2>Photograph Processing</h2>
        <p>In the future, many professions may no longer require photo processing by actual professionals, leaving
            people unemployed. Although photograph processing has become automated and can be done in less time and for
            less money with the use of computer programs and tools, some people prefer the handmade approach, which
            might be a niche vocation depending on your network and ability to keep clients in the future.
            The more you know about technology and upcoming advances, the easier it will be to keep your job safe,
            regardless of the field you want to work in. Despite the fact that many occupations and roles will be
            replaced by robots and other machines in the near future, there will always be new opportunities for new
            jobs as technology advances.
            Robots have the potential to drastically disrupt industries and jobs as a new general-purpose technology. In
            contrast to earlier industry-level studies that predicted dramatic job losses, this research demonstrates
            that robotics investments lead to rises in overall company employment but decreases in the total number of
            managers. It also discovers that investing in robots is linked to an increase in the span of control for
            managers who stay with the company. This research shows that robot adoption is not driven by a need to cut
            labor costs, but rather by a desire to improve product and service quality. These findings support the
            theory that robots reduce variation in manufacturing processes, reducing the need for managers to monitor
            workers to maintain quality.
            Since the Industrial Revolution, machines replacing humans in the workplace have been a constant source of
            anxiety, and with the advent of automation in recent decades, it has become a hot issue of discussion.
            However, the excitement has so far exceeded the facts concerning how automation — particularly robots that
            do not require humans to operate — affects employment and earnings.
            The displacement effect, in which robots or other automation complete jobs previously performed by workers,
            has a negative impact on wages and employment. Technology also has a beneficial impact on productivity by
            making tasks easier to accomplish or by providing workers with new occupations and tasks. Automation
            technologies, according to the researchers, always have both displacement and productivity effects, but
            robots create a higher displacement effect.
