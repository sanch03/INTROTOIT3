        <h1><b> Group Reflection</b></h1>

        <p> Sanchit</p>
        <p> I believe our group performed very well in this assignment, we were able to get a team plan ready very early
            on and executed it well. I found that I was able to complete the tasks assigned to me efficiently because
            everyone else was getting their sections done at a similar pace. If I had to improve upon anything it would
            probably be communication between the group, even though we got everything done there were certain member
            who were missing from many of our conversations/meetings. Something that was surprising was how we were able
            to use a lot of the knowledge we got from assignment 1 and 2 and apply it directly to sections in assignment
            3. One thing I learnt about working in groups is being able to collaborate across different working hours,
            not everyone is available all the time so coordinating group work was a challenge.</p>

        <p> Clinton</p>
        <p> From this assignment, I found that our group was ahead of their games and each member contributed very well,
            as well as getting everything done on time if not before the deadline. In terms of what can be improved on,
            I would say, if possible, to have a proper meeting agenda and then to follow it during the meeting. This is
            because in our meeting, we just kind of wing it and go through topics randomly, making it hard to track.
            What was surprising was the difficulty in making the project idea into something that is somewhat
            functional, as I underestimated how difficult it was to use Bootstrap Studio. What I learnt about groups was
            that even if the workload seems large, with good teammates such as the ones in our group, the work feels
            easy with everyone's collaboration and contributions. </p>

        <p> Vivek </p>
        <p> In this assignment, I think everyone did their allocated work before on time and everyone did a fantastic
            job. As we are doing a group project, so we did an online MS Teams meeting to allocate work and we planned
            to do this assignment as early as possible. I discovered that I was able to accomplish my assigned task
            ahead of schedule. As a group, we performed very well. I believe we could have communicated more
            effectively, which would have aided us in completing this work considerably ahead of schedule. One thing
            I've learned about working in a group is to always trust your teammates. In a group project, everyone should
            believe that the other member will do their task on time and to the best of their abilities.</p>

        <p> Navdeep </p>
        <p> Personally, I believe what went well in this assignment, most definitely, would be that this time around we
            were ‘extremely’ organised, in regard to figuring out who does what(allocations). Additionally, at the
            commencement of this assignment we said “guys let’s try to finish this assignment as early as we possibly
            can”, and each and every one of us stuck by that. Everyone in the group was driven and motivated to finish
            this assignment early, and I would say we actually finished this assignment well before the due date. I
            don’t think there is much to be said when it comes to making a stamen on what could be improved. Only one
            thing I would say which could be improved would be that communication in this assignment, like the previous
            one, was lacking a little bit. I think we could have communicated more, which would have assisted us in
            finishing us this assignment well before the due date. One thing which was surprising was that this time
            around everyone in group clearly understood what they had to do, and they did not need explanation of
            anything. One thing I have learned about group is that organisation is key when it comes to working in a
            group, being organised is essential as it is an extremely important component of completing everything to
            the best of our abilities. </p>

        <p> Jack</p>
        <p> In this assignment, I believe everyone has done their part of work perfectly and sticks to the time thats given by. As a team, we worked effectively together, a very good aspect is that when a job is assigned, everyone can do their part independently, but we also have problem about the communication between the group members and we are lack of the group meeting. What I have learnt about the group is to plan and manage time wisely.</p>

        <p> Pratham</p>
        <p> In Assignment 3 for this group, I strongly believe that everyone killed it in regards to working on individual sections that people were given to or chosen.  The communications were outstanding due to the weekly Microsoft Teams meeting that our group participated very seriously in. What I believe a strength for this group is that everyone communicated very well as a result it made it very easy to get the work done, ask someone for help without waiting hours for a reply and even setting up the team meeting on a weekly schedule based on each members availability.  overall, the group was amazing, and I would love to work with these guys again without a question. </p>
